# MERN-Stack-Todo-List-App
My first attempt at a full stack application, just a basic todo list app using the MERN stack.

So far I have made a very basic backend API for adding, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks and I use mongoose and a cloud mongodb for the database. Next will be the frontend with React.
